## Description
This project focuses on constructing a K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) classifier model using the Spotify dataset in R to anticipate the song preferences of a user. The primary objective is to classify songs as either "like" or "dislike" based on their inherent characteristics, such as features like 'energy', 'loudness', and 'valence'. The Spotify dataset, obtained from a popular music streaming platform, provides a diverse range of attributes for each song, which have been labeled as "like" or "dislike" according to user preferences. Two distinct datasets, spotify.csv (used as the training set) and spot100.csv (used as a song pool for prediction), were utilized in this analysis.

## Objectives
The main goal of this project is to develop a KNN classifier model that accurately predicts a user's song preferences using the Spotify dataset. By analyzing the training set, spotify.csv, the model will learn the relationships between song attributes and the user's labeled preferences. The model will then be applied to the song pool dataset, spot100.csv, to determine whether a selected song would be liked or disliked by the user. This project aims to explore the potential of recommending songs based on their intricate attributes, such as tempo and danceability, to provide personalized music recommendations tailored to a user's specific tastes. By achieving this objective, the project seeks to enhance the precision and appeal of song recommendations beyond traditional approaches based solely on artist and genre information.
